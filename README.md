# adventOfLisp
Making advent of code 2022 in Common Lisp to learn this language.

To use each script :

- Create a input file : input_day
with "day" the day of the challenge (one, two, ...)

- Install sbcl and run sbcl --script the_lisp_file

Those scripts are a part of my first lisp programs, be indulgent.
